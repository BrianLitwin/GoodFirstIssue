# GoodFirstIssue

Check out the prototype: www.goodfirstissue.com

The goal of this site is to provide a place where OS contributors, particularly beginners, can quickly find a bunch of projects that are welcoming to new contributors and contributions. Currently we do this by fetching repos with issues marked "good first issue" and/or "help wanted" (and/or user defined labels). 

# Current Status 

The website is currently functional and presentable. 

We're using React.js and Jest/Enzyme for testing. 

# Contributing 

Contributions are welcome! Opening an issue before you submit code can be a good idea, but not required. 

If you're looking for places to contribute, check out [issues labeled "good first issue"][gfi], of course! 

Check out [Sourcecred's contributing guide][scg] for some thoughts on how to write great commits.
