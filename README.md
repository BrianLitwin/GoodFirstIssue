# GoodFirstIssue

Check out the prototype: www.goodfirstissue.com

The goal of the site is to provide beginner/intermediate OS contributors with a bunch of ideas for projects to contribute to, as well as gain a sense of the OS landscape for new contributors in their particular language. Currently we accomplish this by fetching repos with issues marked "good first issue" and/or "help wanted". Users can also add their own labels to the list of labels fetched. 

# Current Status 

The website is currently functional and presentable with lots of room to grow. 

The site uses React.js and Jest/Enzyme for testing. 

# Contributing 

Contributions are welcome! Opening an issue before you submit code can be a good idea, but not required. 

If you're looking for places to contribute, check out [issues labeled "good first issue"][gfi], of course! 

Check out [Sourcecred's contributing guide][scg] for some thoughts on how to write great commits.
